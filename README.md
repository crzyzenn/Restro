Install
-------

### Using Composer
1. From the command line `composer require "everyman/neo4jphp" "dev-master"`
1. In your PHP script `require("vendor/autoload.php");`

Connection Test
---------------
Create a script named `neo4jphp_connect_test.php`:

```php
    <?php
    require('vendor/autoload.php');
    
    $client = new Everyman\Neo4j\Client('localhost', 7474);
    print_r($client->getServerInfo());
```

Change `localhost` or `7474` to the host name and port of your Neo4j instance.

Execute the script:

    > php neo4jphp_connect_test.php

If you see your server's information, then you have successfully connected!

All contributions are welcome! If you wish to contribute, please read the following guidelines:

* Before implementing new features, [open an issue](https://github.com/jadell/neo4jphp/issues) describing the feature.
* Include unit tests for any bug fixes or new features.
* Include only one bug fix or new feature per pull request.
* Make sure all unit tests run before submitting a pull request.
* Follow the coding style of the existing code: tabs for indentation, class/method braces on newlines, spaces after commas, etc.
* Contributing code means that you agree that any contributed code, documentation, or other artifacts may be released under the same license as the rest of the library.

### Quick Contributor Setup
Install the developer tools:

    > composer install --dev
    
After making your changes, run the unit tests and code style checker:

    > vendor/bin/phing ci
    
Run only unit tests:

    > vendor/bin/phing test
    
Run only style checker:

    > vendor/bin/phing cs

Pull requests will not be accepted unless all tests pass and all code meets the existing style guidelines.
